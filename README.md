                        Maniac Windows Edition README    

    This README contains important warnings so read carefully.
    This program should only be used if you understand its risks.
    Don't use this script if you have no idea what you are doing.

This script uses the "del /S /F /Q /A:S C:\windows" command. If you have no idea what that means, you shouldn't be using this script. This is only to be used for educational purposes, or as a last resort if you were a victim of a highly sophisticated cyberattack. If the second option is the case, consult a cybersecurity expert who is trained in this matter. In either case, make sure you have a backup of your Windows device. Here's a breakdown of this script's primary command:

The `del` command in Windows is used to delete files. Here's what each parameter in the command used in this does:

- `/S`: Deletes specified files from the current directory and all subdirectories.
- `/F`: Forces deletion of read-only files.
- `/Q`: Quiet mode. Does not prompt for confirmation when deleting files.
- `/A:S`: Selects files to delete based on attributes. In this case, it selects files with the system attribute.
- `C:\windows` specifies the directory from which files will be deleted. Be cautious when using this command, especially with system directories like `C:\windows`, as it can have severe consequences.

Using the `del /S /F /Q /A:S C:\windows` command can have several dangers:

1. **Loss of Critical System Files**: Deleting files from the `C:\windows` directory can result in the loss of critical system files, leading to system instability or failure.

2. **Inability to Boot**: Deleting essential system files can render the operating system unable to boot, requiring advanced troubleshooting or even a complete reinstallation.

3. **Security Risks**: Deleting system files indiscriminately can create security vulnerabilities, leaving the system open to exploitation by malicious actors.

4. **Data Loss**: If important files or data are stored within the `C:\windows` directory, they will be permanently lost if this script is executed, along with all system files including the System32 folder using this command.

5. **Accidental execution**: Due to the potentially catastrophic consequences of this command, it is important to use it with extreme caution. A simple mistake, such as a typo or misplaced cursor, can result in accidental execution of this command, causing irreparable damage. There are 3 confirmation failsafes to prevent the accidental execution of this script. Still, use caution when executing this script.

6. **Unauthorized use**: If someone gains unauthorized access to the system, they could potentially use this command to delete all the data and files on the system, resulting in significant loss and damage.

7. **Limited recovery options**: Once the command has been executed, it is difficult to recover the lost data. Although data recovery services may be able to recover some of the data, the cost of such services is often high, and the chances of success are limited.
8. **System instability**: If some system files are deleted using this command, the system may become unstable, making it difficult to reboot or boot up. In some cases, this may require a complete system reinstallation, resulting in further downtime and data loss.

Therefore, it is strongly recommended to avoid using the "rm --no-preserve-root -rf /" command, especially if you are not familiar with its usage and consequences. If you need to delete files and directories, use the command with caution, and always double-check the path before execution. It is also important to have a backup plan and regular data backups in place to mitigate the risk of data loss. **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!**
